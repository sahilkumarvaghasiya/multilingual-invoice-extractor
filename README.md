# Multilingual Invoice Extractor with LangChain

This project leverages Google's LangChain technology to create a powerful multilingual invoice extractor. It streamlines invoice processing by accurately extracting key information like amounts, dates, and vendor details from invoices in various languages.

**Ideal for:**

- Anyone who needs to automate multilingual invoice processing.
- Businesses that handle invoices from international clients or suppliers.
- Individuals seeking to simplify invoice management across different languages.

**Features:**

- **Multilingual Support:** Processes invoices in various languages (specify languages if applicable). Train the model on additional languages for broader coverage.
- **Critical Invoice Data Extraction:** Accurately extracts essential information like amounts, dates, vendor details, and other relevant fields based on your training data.
- **Streamlit Interface (Optional):** Provides a user-friendly interface (if applicable) for uploading invoice images or inputting invoice text, making interaction seamless.
- **LangChain Integration:** Built upon Google's innovative LangChain technology, ensuring scalability and efficient text processing capabilities.

**Installation:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python (version X.X or later) and Git installed on your system. You can download them from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://git-scm.com/downloads, respectively.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python installations.
   - Use `venv` (Python 3.3+) or `virtualenv` (older versions) to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # Replace 'venv' with your desired environment name
